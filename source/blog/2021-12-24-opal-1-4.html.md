We are proud to announce an immediate availability of Opal 1.4!

Opal is a Ruby to JavaScript (ES5) compiler allowing you to write frontend code in pure Ruby (and a lot more!).

This version of Opal is about compatibility with Ruby 3.1 and lots of internal improvement around performance, code size, and readability of the generated code. Opal 1.3 was released just about 2 months ago, but we really wanted to get 3.1-level compatibility out around the time Ruby 3.1 is released this Christmas.

_As always, you don't need to run Opal with Ruby 3.1 to benefit from the 3.1-level features, Ruby 2.6 will do just fine :)_

## New Ruby 3.1 features

`Class#subclasses`, `Class#descendants`, syntax like `h = {a:}` is all supported, along with a lot of other Ruby 3.1 features. You can take a look at [our changelog](https://github.com/opal/opal/releases/tag/v1.4.0) or Ruby 3.1 release notes to read about all the new features we have. Big thanks to the people working on [whitequark/parser](https://github.com/whitequark/parser) - their hard work made this possible - it didn't require from us any effort to support the new syntax features!

We also added some features from older versions of Ruby that we missed. For example: `Kernel#local_variables` and `Enumerator::ArithmeticSequence`.

## Generated size optimization

Despite the fact, that we added a lot of features, Opal 1.4 is 20% smaller than Opal 1.3 (minified) and just a little bit larger than Opal 1.0.0. Your web applications should be about 10% - 20% smaller uncompressed, which should directly translate to better performance and load times. Please take a look at our [blog post](https://opalrb.com/blog/2021/11/24/optimizing-opal-output-for-size/) if you are interested in how we achieved this. In addition to that the produced code is way more readable than before.

Jan Biedermann who develops [isomorfeus](https://github.com/isomorfeus), a Preact-based framework using Opal reported the following numbers:

```

10000 Themed and Styled LC took: 505ms  473ms
```

## `PromiseV2` is now declared stable!

From my personal experience, it's very simple to replace the old `Promise` with the new `PromiseV2` and I didn't have any issues. While in Opal 1.2 and 1.3 it was a developer preview, we now declare it as stable and a recommended way to do `Promise`s.

## Conclusion

Merry Christmas everyone and we hope that Opal 1.4 will be a present you will all enjoy!
