We have released Opal v1.3.0 a week ago and today we are releasing Opal v1.3.1 containing a few last minute fixes. We plan Opal v1.3 to be supported with a best-effort principle for a longer term, backporting bugfixes.

This is quite a big release with a special focus on developer tools and error reporting improvements.

## Preliminary ES Modules support

Although we didn't yet fully integrate with Webpack as originally planned, Jan Biedermann (of the Isomorfeus project) contributed some preliminary ES Modules support.

If you use Isomorfeus you can take advantage of it with its ESBuild integration and the newly added autoload hooks, which finally works without requiring a patched version of Opal.

If you don't use it you can still roll your own integration, making autoload dynamically fetch modules from the server as they're imported.

We are planning to work on a proper `import` and npm package support for the next release, along with Ruby 3.1 support.

## Newly supported language features

We already support a lot of Ruby 3.0 features. This release fills a few missing gaps, most of which will only be used in very niche usecases.

### Refinements

Refinements are now mostly supported. If you don't like monkey patching, this feature can improve your codebase.

### `binding`

Binding allows you to take a peek at local variables in a given scope. You probably most likely know it for `binding.irb` or `binding.pry` - while we don't support those yet, it's now only a matter of time when it gets implemented - all prerequisites are there already.

### `autoload`

Autoload statements will cause a file to be included inside your Opal bundle, but won't load it instantly. We moved a bigger deal of corelib to benefit from faster load times.

This support can also be used to load files dynamically, like `opal-zeitwerk` does in Isomorfeus.

### `retry`

Due to an asynchronous nature of JavaScript, it probably won't have much use here. But still, you can now use this statement to restart the code in a rescue clause.

### `super` improvements

The following code used to call a super function with `(a,b,c)` arguments, now it correctly calls it with `(4,b,c)`. Also a few more edge cases were corrected.

```ruby
def method(a,b,c)
  a = 4
  super
end
```

### `stdin` and `gets` support

We have now a larger synchronous IO support. `gets` is implemented on a browser via `prompt` (aka that annoying alert popup with a text field), on other platforms, including headless chrome, it bridges `stdin` properly.

**Reminder:** for basic support of other platforms than browser, you need to `require "opal/platform"`. For extended support of NodeJS, you need to `require "nodejs"`.

```
$ opal -ropal/platform -e 'p gets'
123
"123\n"
```

_Implementing `gets` is all that's needed to make a runner able to be ran in the REPL mode_

### Global variable aliases

Certainly a lesser known feature of Ruby. Did you know it's possible to write this:

```ruby
alias $PROGRAM_NAME $0
$PROGRAM_NAME = "abc" # This changes $0 as well!
```

Opal has you covered.

### Flip-flop

This Perl-inspired feature was almost removed in Ruby 3.0. But due to some interest, it was actually fixed. Opal now supports this as well! Have you never heard of this feature? That's fair, it mostly isn't present in production code, but can be used for writing unreadable code like this:

```ruby
a=b=c=(1..100).each do |num|
  print num, ?\r,
    ("Fizz" unless (a = !a) .. (a = !a)),
    ("Buzz" unless (b = !b) ... !((c = !c) .. (c = !c))),
    ?\n
end
```

## Toolkit improvements

### opal-repl

The `opal-repl` command line tool gained a number of improvements:

* Windows support
* Colored output
* Support for printing native JS Objects / null / undefined
* Pry-like `ls` support
* Support for everything that opal command line tool supports
* Support for multiple runners: nodejs, chrome, gjs, quickjs, miniracer (used to be miniracer only)

```

```

### New runners

Runners are how you can use different environments to run Opal code on, using our `opal` command line tool. We added support for 3 new runners:

* `gjs` - the GNOME JavaScript engine based on Gecko's JS engine
* `quickjs` - an independently developed JavaScript engine with a good embedding support: https://bellard.org/quickjs/
* `miniracer` - Ruby bindings to pure V8 (used to be supported only for repl)

```
$ opal -ropal/platform -Rchrome -e 'p OPAL_PLATFORM'
"headless-chrome"
$ opal -ropal/platform -Rnodejs -e 'p OPAL_PLATFORM'
"nodejs"
$ opal -ropal/platform -Rgjs -e 'p OPAL_PLATFORM'
"gjs"
$ opal -ropal/platform -Rquickjs -e 'p OPAL_PLATFORM'
"quickjs"
$ opal -ropal/platform -Rminiracer -e 'p OPAL_PLATFORM'
"opal-miniracer"
```

While the support for those is preliminary and works only with `stdio`, there is a possibility to extend those implementations when needed (patches welcome!). GJS is now one of the primary GNOME development platforms, powering software like [Flatseal](https://github.com/tchx84/Flatseal), allowing you to bridge all GNOME libraries, like Glib or GTK4 (making it a fully featured Node.js alternative, though much more low level and a lot less popular - but that's a digression).

### Source map debugger

We have improved the source map support in this release. It should now much more accurately tell you which line/column is being executed. Which means - easier debugging! And that's not all, if source mapping goes wrong, you can always use our new source map debugging tool:

```
$ opal --debug-source-map -e '[1,2,3,4].each { |i| p i }'
https://sokra.github.io/source-map-visualization/#base64,T3BhbC5xdWV1ZShmdW5jdGlvbihPcGFsKSB7LyogR2VuZXJhdGVkIGJ5IE9wYWwgMS4zLjAgKi8KICB2YXIgJCQxLCBzZWxmID0gT3BhbC50b3AsICRuZXN0aW5nID0gW10sIG5pbCA9IE9wYWwubmlsLCAkJCQgPSBPcGFsLiQkJCwgJCQgPSBPcGFsLiQkLCAkc2VuZCA9IE9wYWwuc2VuZDsKCiAgT3BhbC5hZGRfc3R1YnMoWyckZWFjaCcsICckcCddKTsKICByZXR1cm4gJHNlbmQoWzEsIDIsIDMsIDRdLCAnZWFjaCcsIFtdLCAoJCQxID0gZnVuY3Rpb24oaSl7dmFyIHNlbGYgPSAkJDEuJCRzID09IG51bGwgPyB0aGlzIDogJCQxLiQkczsKCiAgICAKICAgIAogICAgaWYgKGkgPT0gbnVsbCkgewogICAgICBpID0gbmlsOwogICAgfTsKICAgIHJldHVybiBzZWxmLiRwKGkpO30sICQkMS4kJHMgPSBzZWxmLCAkJDEuJCRhcml0eSA9IDEsICQkMSkpCn0pOwo=,eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjozLCJzb3VyY2VSb290IjoiIiwic291cmNlcyI6WyItZSJdLCJzb3VyY2VzQ29udGVudCI6WyJbMSwyLDMsNF0uZWFjaCB7IHxpfCBwIGkgfSJdLCJuYW1lcyI6WyI8bWFpbj4iLCJlYWNoIiwiMSIsIjIiLCIzIiwiNCIsImJsb2NrIGluIDxtYWluPiIsImkiLCJibG9jayAoMiBsZXZlbHMpIGluIDxtYWluPiIsInNlbGYiLCJwIl0sIm1hcHBpbmdzIjoiQUFBQUEsMkJBQUFBO0VBQUFBOztFQUFBQTtFQUFBQSxPQUFTQyxNQUFULENBQUNDLENBQUQsRUFBR0MsQ0FBSCxFQUFLQyxDQUFMLEVBQU9DLENBQVAsQ0FBU0osUUFBQUEsRUFBQUEsRUFBQUEsRUFBTUssZ0JBQUdDLENBQUhELEVBQUFFOzs7O0lBQUc7SUFBQTtJQUFBO0lBQUdBLE9BQUFDLElBQUFDLEdBQUFBLENBQUVILENBQUZHLEVBQU5KLGtCQUFBQSxpQkFBQUEsS0FBTkw7QUFBVEQ7In0=,WzEsMiwzLDRdLmVhY2ggeyB8aXwgcCBpIH0=
```

This utility can be also used to help you understand which Ruby code corresponds to which JavaScript output, for educational purposes.

### Cache for `Opal::Builder`

_Sprockets doesn't use `Opal::Builder` - it has its own cache, though it may need to be configured._

Upgrade to Opal 1.3 and forget the long compilation times when using `opal` command line tool or `Opal::Builder` thru any other means (like `Opal::SimpleServer`). This is implemented by caching the marshaled Compiler objects.

4x improvement for a simple script:

```
$ time opal _1.2.0_ -e 'p 123'
123

real    0m2.321s
user    0m2.213s
sys    0m0.107s
$ time opal _1.3.0_ -e 'p 123'
123

real    0m0.537s
user    0m0.450s
sys    0m0.090s
```

8x when including more core, e.g. `opal-parser`:

```
$ time opal _1.2.0_ -ropal-parser -e 'p eval("(0..1)")'
Object freezing is not supported by Opal
0..1

real    0m12.555s
user    0m12.250s
sys    0m0.349s
$ time opal _1.3.0_ -ropal-parser -e 'p eval("(0..1)")'
Object freezing is not supported by Opal
0..1

real    0m1.512s
user    0m1.405s
sys    0m0.249s
```

## Async/await support

*This big feature is experimental, and may totally change in future releases of Opal.*

This complements the `PromiseV2` feature introduced in Opal v1.2 and uses magic comments and a supported library (aptly named `async`) to **await** on JavaScript native promises.

Check it out:

```ruby
# await: sleep
require "await"

puts "Let's wait 2 seconds..."
sleep 2
puts "Done!"
```

Please consult documentation of this feature: https://opalrb.com/docs/guides/v1.3.0/async

We are leaving this as experimental, because, as an Opal specific feature. Although it's not supported by Ruby itself the syntax is fully compatible, maybe some unexpected breakthrough will happen, with a port to a gem or to the language itself.

## Conclusion

Are you starting to make a new web application and don't want to be forced to write JavaScript on the frontend?

If you are adventurous, why not try Opal? You may be surprised how ready it is for your usecase! :D
